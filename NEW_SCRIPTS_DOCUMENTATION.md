#### Rule-Based Processing (90% of work)
- **Document Classification**: Categorizes by folder structure and file patterns
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes duplicates, templates, archived files, low-value documents
- **Metadata Extraction**: Project IDs, client names, revision numbers using regex
- **Revision Management**: Automatically keeps latest revisions (Rev 102 over Rev 101)
- **Category Organization**: Groups documents into standardized AV project categories

#### Strategic AI Enhancement (10% of work)
- **Project Summaries**: AI-generated summaries for projects with 3+ documents
- **Scope Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of technical scope and systems
- **Focused API Calls**: Uses Claude Haiku for fast, cost-effective insights
