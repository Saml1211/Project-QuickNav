# Active Context â€“ Project QuickNav

## Current Focus

All major components of Project QuickNav have been implemented:

- Python backend for folder lookup
- AutoHotkey GUI for user interaction
- MCP server for AI/automation integration

Current focus has shifted from development to stabilization and testing. Iterative testing of `lld_navigator.ahk` is underway.
- Initial AHK runtime warnings (e.g., `A_IsDarkMode`, `this` variable usage in `ShowNotification`) have been addressed.
- Some linter errors related to these warnings have been resolved.
- Other linter issues persist, notably incorrect include path resolution for `lld_navigator_controller.ahk` by the linter and `test_fail` function conflicts in AHK test scripts.
- The AHK script (`lld_navigator.ahk`) is not yet 100% working, and further debugging and refinement are required.

A key area remains the AHK integration test suite, covering GUI/Python backend interaction.
- Monitoring application stability following the `v` variable handling improvements in `lld_navigator_controller.ahk`.
- An unrelated linter error persists in `tests/ahk/test_window_resizing.ahk` at line 15: "This function 'test_fail' declaration conflicts with an existing Func". This needs to be addressed as a separate task.

## Recent Changes

- Completed initial implementation of all three core components.
- Integrated backend with both frontend and MCP server.
- Validated end-to-end operation for user and AI workflows.
- Fixed issue with AHK script not starting the Python backend correctly by removing the initialization code and only running the backend when needed with the proper job number argument.
- Implemented a dedicated AHK integration test suite (`tests/ahk/`), including a reusable test runner and utility module. All core backend error and selection logic flows now have automated coverage. The suite is CI-ready via an appropriate exit code and summary output.
- Addressed `A_IsDarkMode` initialization and `this` variable usage warnings in `lld_navigator.ahk`.
- Ongoing efforts to resolve linter errors in AHK scripts and iteratively test `lld_navigator.ahk` functionality.
- **Enhanced `v` Variable Handling (lld_navigator_controller.ahk):** Implemented robust checks for the `v` variable, which is typically the result of `ValidateAndNormalizeInputs`. Changes include:
    - Verifying `v` is an object (`IsObject(v)`) and has the `valid` key (`v.Has("valid")`) before accessing `v.valid`.
    - Logging a CRITICAL error if `v` is not structured as expected.
    - Providing fallback error messages if `v.errorMsg` is missing or empty when `v.valid` is false.
These changes enhance resilience against unexpected return values from input validation, specifically around lines 634 and 951 in `lld_navigator_controller.ahk`.

## Potential Next Steps

- **AHK Debugging:** Continue to identify and fix remaining errors in `lld_navigator.ahk`.
- **Linter Configuration/Resolution:** Investigate linter behavior for include path resolution and function conflicts if they impede development or hide real issues.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand test coverage for various input cases, error handling, and integration points once the main script stabilizes.
- **Packaging & Distribution:** Prepare installation scripts or packages for easy deployment across multiple workstations.
- **User Documentation:** Develop clear usage and troubleshooting guides.
- **User Feedback:** Solicit feedback from target users to identify pain points or desired enhancements.
- **Cross-platform Investigation:** Assess feasibility of replacing/upgrading the frontend for non-Windows environments.
- **Integration Pipeline:** Integrate AHK test suite into automated CI/CD pipelines for continuous feedback.
- **Utility Refactor:** Further develop `test_utils.ahk` for more reusable assertions and helpers.
- **Edge Cases:** Add additional tests for unhandled edge scenarios and GUI-backend race conditions.
- Address the linter error concerning the duplicate `test_fail` function in `tests/ahk/test_window_resizing.ahk`.
- Conduct thorough testing of the QuickNav application to ensure all recent changes are stable.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Decision to keep the inter-process protocol simple and based on stdout for maximum reliability.
- Monitor for edge cases in path resolution, especially with atypical project code formats or directory structures.
- Decision to run the Python backend only when needed rather than as a persistent process, improving reliability and simplifying the workflow.
- Consideration for future enhancements such as search history, favorites, or direct integration with code editors.
