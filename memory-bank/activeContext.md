# Active Context â€“ Project QuickNav

## Current Focus

All major components of Project QuickNav have been implemented:
- Python backend for folder lookup
- AutoHotkey GUI for user interaction
- MCP server for AI/automation integration

Current focus has shifted from development to stabilization, testing, and preparation for broader use.

A key area is the new AHK integration test suite, covering GUI/Python backend interaction. This suite supports robust validation of error handling, selection logic, and UI feedback.

## Recent Changes

- Completed initial implementation of all three core components.
- Integrated backend with both frontend and MCP server.
- Validated end-to-end operation for user and AI workflows.
- Fixed issue with AHK script not starting the Python backend correctly by removing the initialization code and only running the backend when needed with the proper job number argument.
- Implemented a dedicated AHK integration test suite (`tests/ahk/`), including a reusable test runner and utility module. All core backend error and selection logic flows now have automated coverage. The suite is CI-ready via an appropriate exit code and summary output.

## Potential Next Steps

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand test coverage for various input cases, error handling, and integration points.
- **Packaging & Distribution:** Prepare installation scripts or packages for easy deployment across multiple workstations.
- **User Documentation:** Develop clear usage and troubleshooting guides.
- **User Feedback:** Solicit feedback from target users to identify pain points or desired enhancements.
- **Cross-platform Investigation:** Assess feasibility of replacing/upgrading the frontend for non-Windows environments.
- **Integration Pipeline:** Integrate AHK test suite into automated CI/CD pipelines for continuous feedback.
- **Utility Refactor:** Further develop `test_utils.ahk` for more reusable assertions and helpers.
- **Edge Cases:** Add additional tests for unhandled edge scenarios and GUI-backend race conditions.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Decision to keep the inter-process protocol simple and based on stdout for maximum reliability.
- Monitor for edge cases in path resolution, especially with atypical project code formats or directory structures.
- Decision to run the Python backend only when needed rather than as a persistent process, improving reliability and simplifying the workflow.
- Consideration for future enhancements such as search history, favorites, or direct integration with code editors.
