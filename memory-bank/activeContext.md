# Active Context – Project QuickNav

## Current Focus

Project QuickNav has evolved from a simple navigation tool into a comprehensive AV project intelligence platform with advanced analysis capabilities:

- **Core Components**: Python backend, AutoHotkey GUI, MCP server (production ready)
- **Training Data System**: Document discovery and training data generation (production ready)
- **Advanced Analysis Suite**: Four powerful scripts for project intelligence and AI agent improvement
- **NEW: Build System**: Robust AutoHotkey compilation system for standalone EXE distribution

**LATEST MILESTONE: Build System Optimization** - Successfully created and refined `scripts/build_exe.ps1` for proper AutoHotkey EXE compilation:

- **Fixed Architecture Understanding**: Correctly identified this as an AutoHotkey application requiring AHK2EXE compilation (not Python/PyInstaller)
- **Robust Path Resolution**: Dynamic script location detection works from any directory
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies with clear user feedback
- **Multi-Location Detection**: Searches common AutoHotkey v2 installation paths automatically
- **Professional Output**: Clean terminal output with file size reporting and success confirmation

The project now has a complete build pipeline for creating distributable EXE files from the AutoHotkey source.

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Analysis & Extraction Suite** - Successfully developed four new scripts that transform Project QuickNav into a comprehensive AV project analysis platform:

1. **`hybrid_training_analyzer.py`** - Hybrid rule-based + AI training data processor
2. **`ai_agent_training_generator.py`** - AI agent training data and insights generator
3. **`project_extractor.py`** - Comprehensive project-specific information extractor
4. **`scope_generator.py`** - Real scope content extraction from project documents

Current development capability includes both advanced analytics and professional build/distribution systems.

## Integration Workflow

### Enhanced Processing Pipeline
1. **QuickNav** generates `training_data_[project].json`
2. **Hybrid Analyzer** processes all training files → `hybrid_analysis_results.json`
3. **AI Training Generator** creates training examples → `ai_agent_training_dataset.json`
4. **Project Extractor** analyzes specific projects → `project_profile_[id].json`
5. **Scope Generator** creates markdown documentation → `[project_id]_project_scope.md`
