# Active Context – Project QuickNav

## Current Focus

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Repository Split Complete** - Successfully split Project QuickNav into two focused repositories:

**QuickNav-Core (this repository):**
- **Core Components**: Python backend, AutoHotkey GUI, MCP server (production ready)
- **Training Data System**: Document discovery and training data generation (production ready)
- **Build System**: Robust AutoHotkey compilation system for standalone EXE distribution

**AV Project Analysis Tools (separate repository):**
- **Advanced Analysis Suite**: Four powerful scripts for project intelligence and AI agent improvement
- **Hybrid Training Analyzer**: 90% rule-based + 10% AI processing for optimal speed and reliability
- **AI Agent Training Generator**: Creates structured training examples and actionable insights
- **Project Extractor**: Comprehensive project-specific analysis and health assessment
- **Scope Generator**: Professional client-ready project scope documents

**LATEST MILESTONE: Build System Optimization** - Successfully created and refined `scripts/build_exe.ps1` for proper AutoHotkey EXE compilation:

- **Fixed Architecture Understanding**: Correctly identified this as an AutoHotkey application requiring AHK2EXE compilation (not Python/PyInstaller)
- **Robust Path Resolution**: Dynamic script location detection works from any directory
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies with clear user feedback
- **Multi-Location Detection**: Searches common AutoHotkey v2 installation paths automatically
- **Professional Output**: Clean terminal output with file size reporting and success confirmation

The project now has a complete build pipeline for creating distributable EXE files from the AutoHotkey source.

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Analysis & Extraction Suite** - Successfully developed four new scripts that transform Project QuickNav into a comprehensive AV project analysis platform:

1. **`hybrid_training_analyzer.py`** - Hybrid rule-based + AI training data processor
2. **`ai_agent_training_generator.py`** - AI agent training data and insights generator
3. **`project_extractor.py`** - Comprehensive project-specific information extractor
4. **`scope_generator.py`** - Real scope content extraction from project documents

Current development capability includes both advanced analytics and professional build/distribution systems.

2. **Copy training data** to AV Project Analysis Tools repository
3. **Hybrid Analyzer** processes all training files → `hybrid_analysis_results.json`
4. **AI Training Generator** creates training examples → `ai_agent_training_dataset.json`
5. **Project Extractor** analyzes specific projects → `project_profile_[id].json`
6. **Scope Generator** creates markdown documentation → `[project_id]_project_scope.md`

### Common Architecture Patterns
- **AV Project Structure**: 6 standard categories (Sales, BOM, PMO, Designs, Handover, Support)
- **Document Classifications**: 15+ AV-specific document types
- **Quality Assessment**: Consistent high/medium/low value patterns
- **Client Mappings**: Standard abbreviation expansions (DWNR → Downer)
