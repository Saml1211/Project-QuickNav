# Active Context – Project QuickNav

## Current Focus

**LATEST CRITICAL FIX: Distribution Path Handling** - Successfully resolved the issue where compiled EXE files in `/dist` couldn't locate Python backend scripts:

**Problem Identified:**
- Compiled AutoHotkey EXE in `/dist` directory was looking for Python scripts in current directory
- Python scripts remain in `/src` directory for development and maintenance
- Distribution EXE failed to execute backend functionality

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Updated Path Resolution Logic**: Modified `lld_navigator.ahk` with intelligent path fallback system
- **Dual-Mode Support**: Script now works correctly both in development (`/src`) and distribution (`/dist`) modes
- **Relative Path Handling**: EXE in `/dist` now correctly locates Python scripts at `../src/`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains full functionality for development workflow in `/src`

**Build Process Verified:**
- Successfully compiled updated AHK script to `quicknav-1.0.0-win64.exe` (1.3MB)
- Tested build pipeline: `scripts/build_exe.ps1` working correctly
- Distribution EXE now fully functional with proper backend script access

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Repository Split Complete** - Successfully split Project QuickNav into two focused repositories:

**QuickNav-Core (this repository):**
- **Core Components**: Python backend, AutoHotkey GUI, MCP server (production ready)
- **Training Data System**: Document discovery and training data generation (production ready)
- **Build System**: Robust AutoHotkey compilation system for standalone EXE distribution
- **FIXED**: Distribution path handling for compiled executables

**AV Project Analysis Tools (separate repository):**
- **Advanced Analysis Suite**: Four powerful scripts for project intelligence and AI agent improvement
- **Hybrid Training Analyzer**: 90% rule-based + 10% AI processing for optimal speed and reliability
- **AI Agent Training Generator**: Creates structured training examples and actionable insights
- **Project Extractor**: Comprehensive project-specific analysis and health assessment
- **Scope Generator**: Professional client-ready project scope documents

**LATEST MILESTONE: Build System Optimization** - Successfully created and refined `scripts/build_exe.ps1` for proper AutoHotkey EXE compilation:

- **Fixed Architecture Understanding**: Correctly identified this as an AutoHotkey application requiring AHK2EXE compilation (not Python/PyInstaller)
- **Robust Path Resolution**: Dynamic script location detection works from any directory
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies with clear user feedback
- **Multi-Location Detection**: Searches common AutoHotkey v2 installation paths automatically
- **Professional Output**: Clean terminal output with file size reporting and success confirmation
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved distribution path handling for compiled EXE deployment

The project now has a complete build pipeline for creating distributable EXE files from the AutoHotkey source, with proper path resolution for both development and production environments.

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Analysis & Extraction Suite** - Successfully developed four new scripts that transform Project QuickNav into a comprehensive AV project analysis platform:

1. **`hybrid_training_analyzer.py`** - Hybrid rule-based + AI training data processor
2. **`ai_agent_training_generator.py`** - AI agent training data and insights generator
3. **`project_extractor.py`** - Comprehensive project-specific information extractor
4. **`scope_generator.py`** - Real scope content extraction from project documents

Current development capability includes both advanced analytics and professional build/distribution systems.

## Recent Changes

### Critical Distribution Fix (Latest)
- **RESOLVED: EXE Path Handling Issue** - Fixed critical bug where compiled EXE couldn't locate Python scripts:
