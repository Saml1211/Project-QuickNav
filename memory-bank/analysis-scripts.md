# Analysis Scripts – Project QuickNav

## Overview

Four advanced analysis scripts have been developed to extend Project QuickNav from a navigation utility into a comprehensive AV project intelligence platform. These scripts transform raw training data into actionable business intelligence, AI development resources, and professional client documentation.

## Script Architecture

### 1. Hybrid Training Analyzer (`hybrid_training_analyzer.py`)

**Purpose**: High-performance analysis of training data using a hybrid approach that solves reliability and speed issues of pure AI methods.

#### Key Design Principles
- **90% Rule-Based Processing**: Deterministic classification, filtering, and metadata extraction
- **10% Strategic AI Enhancement**: AI used only for high-value insights (project summaries, scope analysis)
- **Performance Optimized**: Completes analysis in under 2 minutes vs. slow pure AI approaches
- **Error Resilient**: Eliminates JSON parsing errors and timeouts through robust rule-based foundation

#### Core Capabilities
- **Document Classification**: Categorizes documents by AV project patterns and file characteristics
- **Quality Assessment**: Filters out templates, duplicates, archived files, and low-value documents
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts project IDs, client names, revision numbers using regex patterns
- **Revision Management**: Automatically identifies and keeps latest document revisions
- **Client Name Expansion**: Maps abbreviations to full client names (DWNR → Downer)
- **AI Summaries**: Generates project summaries for projects with 3+ documents using Claude Haiku

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# Key data structures and patterns
