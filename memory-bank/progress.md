# Progress â€“ Project QuickNav

## What Works

- Core implementation of the three main components is complete:
  - Python backend for project directory lookup.
  - AutoHotkey frontend for user interaction and navigation (core UI elements in place, some known issues exist).
  - MCP server for AI and automation integration.
- Basic end-to-end workflow for job number input and subfolder selection is partially functional for human users, but undergoing debugging.
- Some AHK runtime warnings (e.g. `A_IsDarkMode`, `this` in `ShowNotification`) have been resolved.
- **Input Validation Robustness:** The handling of the `v` variable (result of input validation) in `lld_navigator_controller.ahk` is now significantly more robust. It correctly handles scenarios where `v` might not be a valid object or lacks expected properties, preventing potential runtime errors.

## What's Left to Build

- **Stabilize AHK Frontend:** Resolve remaining errors and ensure reliable operation of `lld_navigator.ahk`.
- **Resolve Linter Issues:** Address persistent AHK linter errors (include paths, `test_fail` conflicts) if they are not benign, or configure linter appropriately.
- **Expand automated and manual test coverage** for the AHK frontend once stabilized.
- Package the solution for easy installation and update (e.g., installer, script bundle).
- Create comprehensive user and administrator documentation.
- Gather initial user feedback and iterate on usability.
- Explore value-added features (history, favorites, cross-platform support).

## Current Status

- Implementation phase is largely complete, but `lld_navigator.ahk` requires further debugging.
- Iterative testing and refinement of the AHK frontend are in progress.
- All main features are present and integrated, but AHK frontend reliability is not yet 100%.
- Fixed critical issue with the AHK script to properly launch the Python backend only when needed with the correct job number argument.
- Ready for more intensive testing once current AHK issues are resolved.
- All core error handling and selection logic for the backend are covered by automated AHK integration tests.
- The AHK test runner emits a summary and exit code for CI usage.
- Recommend integrating test execution into CI/CD, extending `test_utils.ahk`, and adding further edge case and race condition tests once the main AHK script is stable.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **AHK Script Errors:** `lld_navigator.ahk` is not fully functional and has known errors that need fixing.
- **Linter Discrepancies:** AHK linter shows errors for include paths and `test_fail` conflicts that may not reflect runtime reality or are due to tool limitations in applying fixes.
- Tool is currently Windows-only due to AutoHotkey dependency in the frontend.
- Path resolution assumes standard directory naming conventions.
- Error handling and edge case management in the AHK frontend require further validation.
- No persistent state for user preferences or usage history beyond what's implemented.
- ~~Issue with AHK script not starting the Python backend correctly~~ (RESOLVED)
- **Linter Error (Test Script):** The file `tests/ahk/test_window_resizing.ahk` reports a linter error at line 15 due to a duplicate function declaration for `test_fail`. This does not affect the main application's functionality but should be resolved to ensure test suite integrity. This issue is separate from the `v` variable fixes.

Project QuickNav is functionally near complete, with current efforts focused on debugging and stabilizing the AHK frontend.
