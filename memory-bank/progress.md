# Progress â€“ Project QuickNav

## What Works

- Full implementation of the three main components:
  - Python backend for project directory lookup
  - AutoHotkey frontend for user interaction and navigation
  - MCP server for AI and automation integration
- End-to-end workflow is functional for both human and AI users:
  - Users can enter a 5-digit code and immediately access the correct project folder
  - AI agents can trigger navigation and obtain project paths via MCP

## What's Left to Build

- Expand automated and manual test coverage
- Package the solution for easy installation and update (e.g., installer, script bundle)
- Create comprehensive user and administrator documentation
- Gather initial user feedback and iterate on usability
- Explore value-added features (history, favorites, cross-platform support)

## Current Status

- Implementation phase is complete
- All main features are present and integrated
- Fixed critical issue with the AHK script to properly launch the Python backend only when needed with the correct job number argument
- Ready for formal testing, packaging, and first round of real user trials

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Tool is currently Windows-only due to AutoHotkey dependency in the frontend
- Path resolution assumes standard directory naming conventions
- Error handling and edge case management require further validation
- No persistent state for user preferences or usage history
- ~~Issue with AHK script not starting the Python backend correctly~~ (RESOLVED)

Project QuickNav is now considered functionally complete and ready to enter the testing and feedback phase.
