# Progress â€“ Project QuickNav

## What Works

- Full implementation of the three main components:
  - Python backend for project directory lookup
  - AutoHotkey frontend for user interaction and navigation
  - MCP server for AI and automation integration
- **NEW: Document Discovery & Training Data System:**
  - `discover_documents()` function for recursive document finding (.pdf, .docx, .doc, .rtf)
  - `training_script()` function for comprehensive training data generation
  - AHK GUI integration with "Generate Training Data" toggle option
  - Intelligent filename generation with project number suffixes
  - Organized storage in dedicated `training_data/` directory
  - Support for both single projects and search results
- End-to-end workflow is functional for both human and AI users:
  - Users can enter a 5-digit code and immediately access the correct project folder
  - AI agents can trigger navigation and obtain project paths via MCP
  - **NEW**: Users can optionally generate training data for the accessed project(s)

## What's Left to Build

- **Training Data Enhancements:**
  - Document content extraction for the extracted_info field
  - Training data management utilities (merge, analyze, cleanup)
  - Performance optimization for large document sets
- Expand automated and manual test coverage for new functionality
- Package the solution for easy installation and update (e.g., installer, script bundle)
- Create comprehensive user and administrator documentation including training data workflow
- Gather initial user feedback and iterate on usability
- Explore value-added features (history, favorites, cross-platform support)

## Current Status

- Implementation phase is complete for core functionality
- **NEW: Training data system fully implemented and tested**
- All main features are present and integrated
- Fixed critical issue with the AHK script to properly launch the Python backend only when needed with the correct job number argument
- **Training data generation tested and working:**
  - Individual projects: `training_data_17741.json` (625 documents)
  - Search results: `training_data_search_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` (multiple projects)
  - No file overwrites, organized storage
- Ready for formal testing, packaging, and first round of real user trials including training data workflows

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Tool is currently Windows-only due to AutoHotkey dependency in the frontend
- Path resolution assumes standard directory naming conventions
- Error handling and edge case management require further validation for training data functionality
- No persistent state for user preferences or usage history
- Training data generation may be slow for projects with thousands of documents
- ~~Issue with AHK script not starting the Python backend correctly~~ (RESOLVED)

## Training Data Statistics

Recent testing shows effective document discovery across project types:
- Project 17741: 625 documents discovered
- Project 17742: 5 documents discovered  
- Search "test": 49 documents across 30 projects
- File organization: All stored in `training_data/` with unique naming

Project QuickNav is now considered functionally complete with enhanced AI/ML training data capabilities and ready to enter the testing and feedback phase.
