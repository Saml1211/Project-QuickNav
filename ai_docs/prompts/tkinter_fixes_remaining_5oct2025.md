Execute a comprehensive refactoring and bug-fixing pass on the Project QuickNav Tkinter application, which currently uses a modern, modular architecture with separated concerns including GUIState for centralized state management, LayoutManager for DPI scaling and responsive layout, EventCoordinator for event handling, and specialized section components for individual UI areas.

### **Priority 1: Code Quality, Polish, and Best Practices**

**1.1. Enhance Background Task Management**

* **Problem:** While the application already uses threading for background operations, the task management could be more robust with better error recovery and user feedback.
* **Action:** Improve the existing background task processing in `gui.py` by adding timeout handling, retry mechanisms for failed operations, and better progress reporting through the status bar. Ensure all background operations properly update the UI state and handle cancellation gracefully.

**1.2. Implement Comprehensive Input Validation**

* **Problem:** While basic validation exists in `EventCoordinator`, edge cases and user input errors aren't handled comprehensively.
* **Action:** Enhance the existing validation system to handle edge cases like empty inputs, invalid project numbers, malformed search terms, and provide immediate feedback through the status bar. Integrate validation feedback with the consolidated action button state management.

**1.3. Add Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility**

* **Problem:** While the application has some keyboard shortcuts, comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility features are missing.
* **Action:** Enhance the existing `EventCoordinator` to provide comprehensive keyboard navigation, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard, and add proper focus management and tab order throughout the interface.

**1.4. Implement Data Persistence and Recovery**

* **Problem:** While settings are persisted, operational data like recent projects and user preferences aren't robustly saved and restored.
* **Action:** Enhance the existing `SettingsManager` to implement robust data persistence for recent projects, user preferences, and application state. Add backup and recovery mechanisms for critical data.

**1.5. Add Performance Monitoring and Optimization**

* **Problem:** The application lacks performance monitoring and optimization features despite having caching mechanisms.
* **Action:** Implement performance monitoring using the existing logging infrastructure to track operation times, cache hit rates, and resource usage. Add optimization features like lazy loading for heavy components and memory management for large result sets.

**1.6. Enhance Error Reporting and Debugging**

* **Problem:** While logging exists, error reporting and debugging capabilities are limited for end users and developers.
* **Action:** Enhance the existing logging system to provide detailed error reports, debugging information, and user-friendly error messages. Add diagnostic features that can be enabled through the settings interface.

**1.7. Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework**

* **Problem:** While some test files exist, comprehensive testing coverage is missing for the refactored components.
* **Action:** Create a comprehensive testing framework that covers all major components, including unit tests for the controller, integration tests for the UI components, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows. Ensure tests cover both success and failure scenarios for all major features.
