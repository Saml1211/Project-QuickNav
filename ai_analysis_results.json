Furthermore, a more structured approach to naming conventions and file organization would improve data quality.",
      "The input data is of extremely low quality for analysis.  It only provides a list of file paths and names, offering no insight into the actual document content.  This prevents any meaningful filtering or identification of essential information.  The data structure is consistent, but the lack of extracted content renders it useless for training an AI to extract scope of work and system requirements.  To improve data quality, the 'extracted_info' fields must be populated with the relevant text and data from each document.  Consider using OCR and NLP techniques to extract meaningful information from the PDF and DOCX files.",
      "The data shows a potential issue with inconsistent naming conventions for similar documents (multiple versions of the project handover document).  The 'extracted_info' field is currently empty across all records, indicating a need for information extraction before model training.  The data is primarily focused on a single project, limiting the diversity for training a robust AI model. More project data is needed for effective training.",
      "The input data is of extremely low quality for training purposes.  It only lists file paths without any extracted content.  The 'extracted_info' field is consistently empty, indicating a failure in the data extraction process or a missing step in data preparation.  To be useful for training, the dataset needs to contain the actual text or structured data extracted from the documents.  The current structure suggests a problem with the data pipeline before this analysis stage.  The filenames themselves offer some hints at potential content (floor plans, electrical diagrams), but without the content itself, they are insufficient for training.",

The `extracted_info` field is consistently empty.  To improve data quality, the `extracted_info` field must contain relevant textual data extracted from documents related to AV system design, including specifications, requirements, and scope of work.  The current dataset is unsuitable for training an AI model to perform the desired task.",
      "The input data is of very low quality for training purposes.  All records list file paths to architectural drawings related to joinery and demolition, which are irrelevant to AV system design. The 'extracted_info' field, crucial for training, is completely empty across all records.  The data needs significant improvement; it should include records with populated 'extracted_info' fields containing actual AV system specifications, equipment lists, or design details.  The current dataset only provides file paths, which are insufficient for training an AI to extract relevant information.",

Irrelevant documents like architectural floor plans should be excluded.",
      "The input data is of extremely low quality for training purposes.  All records are file paths pointing to PDF documents, but no actual content from those documents has been extracted. The `extracted_info` field is consistently empty.  This dataset needs significant improvement before it can be used to train an AI model.  The data suggests a problem with the data extraction process; the file paths are correctly identified, but no information is extracted from the PDFs.  To improve the data, the PDF extraction process needs to be reviewed and corrected to populate the `extracted_info` field with relevant data such as text content, tables, and metadata from the documents.",

The data only provides file paths and names, which are insufficient for training an AI to understand AV system design.  The consistent structure of filenames (project number, document type, revision) suggests a well-organized file system, but this structure alone is not helpful for the task.  To improve data quality, the 'extracted_info' field must be populated with text extracted from relevant AV design documents (e.g., specifications, proposals, schematics).  Furthermore, only documents related to the AV system should be included.",
      "The input data is of low quality for the intended purpose.  The file paths point to CAD drawings that are not directly relevant to AV system design.  The absence of extracted information suggests a preprocessing step is missing or failed.

The data only provides file paths and names, which are insufficient for training.  Furthermore, there's a pattern of multiple versions of the same document ('Sales & PO Report'), indicating potential redundancy and a need for better document management practices in the source data.  The presence of many change orders suggests a project with evolving requirements, but without the content of those change orders, this information is useless for training.",
      "The data shows a consistent folder structure for project documents.  However, the 'extracted_info' fields are currently empty, hindering a complete quality assessment.  The presence of multiple revisions (Rev 103, 104, 105) suggests iterative design processes, which should be considered during training data preparation.  The naming convention of documents is generally good, but inconsistent capitalization and spacing should be addressed for improved data processing.",
